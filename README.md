# Hello, I'm Jonathan

I work as a Bayesian data scientist and senior consultant via my own company
[Oreum Industries](https://oreum.io), providing statistical modelling and
expert advisory services to clients in the commercial & specialty insurance
industry.

I'm a huge fan of the [scientific Python ecosystem](https://numfocus.org) and
often try to attend and speak at technical
[conferences](https://insurancedatascience.org) and
[meetups](https://london.pydata.org). I occasionally contribute to
[pymc3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3), and
write technical blogposts at [sedar.co](https://sedar.co), with supporting code
open-sourced on my github [@jonsedar](https://github.com/jonsedar) or at my
company Github [@oreum-industries](https://github.com/oreum-industries).
